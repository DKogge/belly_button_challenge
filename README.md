# belly_button_challenge
Module 14

Created visuals for the belly button data collected from the sample subjects.

Created a bar chart to show the top 10 OTU's (Operational Taxonomic Units) for each subject when selected from the drop down.

Created a bubble chart to show the data in a different manner.

Created a demographic info for each subject to show the details when selected from the dropdown.

I am finding Java to be very dificult - working with the tutors to get through this.
